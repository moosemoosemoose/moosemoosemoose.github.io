<p>Now what?
You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Noooooo! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Oh God, what have I done? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.
Throw her in the brig. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

But I've never been to the moon!
Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.
Hey, whatcha watching?
You know, I was God once.
Shut up and take my money! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Do a flip! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!
Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!
Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Ow, my spirit! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

Shinier than yours, meatbag. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Hello Morbo, how's the family?

Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Why did you bring us here? What are their names? Oh yeah, good luck with that.

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Noooooo! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

When will that be? Soon enough. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Bite my shiny metal ass. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.

Leela's gonna kill me. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. I'll get my kit! One hundred dollars. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Noooooo! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? What are their names? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Look, last night was a mistake. Who are those horrible orange men? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
