<p>Oh yeah, good luck with that.
Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Negative, bossy meat creature! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

How much did you make me?
If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!
But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.
I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Bender, quit destroying the universe! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
I just told you! You've killed me! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Negative, bossy meat creature! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? It's toe-tappingly tragic!

Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

File not found. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Who are those horrible orange men? With gusto. Ask her how her day was. Professor, make a woman out of me.

Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Now what? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Why not indeed! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

File not found. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
