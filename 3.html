<p>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.
What kind of a father would I be if I said no? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. When will that be? Ummm…to eBay?

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Shut up and get to the point!
Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
Really?!
It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! When will that be? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.
No! Don't jump!
Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?
One hundred dollars. You can see how I lived before I met you. I'll get my kit! Really?! No, she'll probably make me do it.

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Say what? Soothe us with sweet lies.

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

Negative, bossy meat creature! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Oh yeah, good luck with that. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

Really?! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Meh. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

You don't know how to do any of those. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Who am I making this out to? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Large bet on myself in round one. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
