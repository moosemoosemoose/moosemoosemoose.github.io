<p>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.
Pansy. Bite my shiny metal ass. I had more, but you go ahead. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Ask her how her day was. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Ummm…to eBay? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

You wouldn't. Ask anyway!
Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I can explain. It's very valuable. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
I just told you! You've killed me! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. No argument here.

Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. We're rescuing ya. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

She also liked to shut up! Bender, we're trying our best. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. You can see how I lived before I met you. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

We're also Santa Claus! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Bite my shiny metal ass. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I never loved you.

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Bender, you risked your life to save me!

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

I just told you! You've killed me! Do a flip! You don't know how to do any of those. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Bite my shiny metal ass. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

But existing is basically all I do! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>
